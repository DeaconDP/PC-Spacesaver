# PC Spacesaver

Guided Windows disk cleanup app. Double-click **PC-Spacesaver.exe** to run — no install, no .NET download, no extra folders.

## Quick start

1. Download or clone this folder.
2. Double-click **`PC-Spacesaver.exe`** in this directory.
3. Click **Scan for Recommendations** to analyze your drive, or follow the checklist manually.

First launch may take a few seconds while the app unpacks bundled runtime files to a temp folder. Later launches are faster.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 version 1809 or later (Windows 11 recommended)
- 64-bit (x64) PC

## What it includes

- **Scan for Recommendations** — measures reclaimable space and lets you choose what to apply
- **20 cleanup techniques** across Quick Wins, System Cleanup, Large Space Wins, and Manual Review
- **Step-by-step guidance** with warnings for risky options
- **One-click tool launchers** for Storage Sense, Disk Cleanup, System Properties, and more
- **Progress tracking** saved in `%LocalAppData%\PCSpacesaver`
- **Dark mode** UI

## Rebuild the exe (developers)

Requires [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) and the Windows application development workload (Visual Studio 2022) or Windows App SDK.

```powershell
.\publish.ps1
```

This writes `PC-Spacesaver.exe` to the project root as a self-contained single file.

## Safety

This app is a guided cleanup helper with a hybrid apply model:

- **Scan** measures reclaimable space (Recycle Bin, Temp, caches, etc.) and ranks recommendations by impact and risk
- **Safe auto-clean** (only after you confirm): empty Recycle Bin, delete user Temp files older than 3 days (skips in-use files)
- **Everything else** opens the appropriate Windows tool — Disk Cleanup, Settings, Explorer — for you to complete manually
- **Advanced / caution actions** are unchecked by default and show explicit risk warnings before apply

It does **not**:

- Silently delete Downloads, browser data, or anything under `C:\Windows`
- Request administrator elevation automatically
- Recommend third-party registry cleaners, manual WinSxS deletion, or Prefetch cleanup
